- 👋 Hi, I’m @AdamZvolanek
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to expand my coding knowledge beyond Matlab and apply it to my at home server to automate and configure.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about docker-compose, but also learning Python and AWS Cloud services on the side. Roadmap wise I am hoping to create a stack for my server's SSO, configure SSO with creating procedures on 'how-to', and then turn to ansible on Ubuntu to configure and control an OS. Once hardware is acquired I hope to create a 'test' server where I will continue building out my docker-compose suite for my own server and begin hosting+configuring a DevOps enviornment. (on the test server of course)
- 💞️ I’m happy to collaborate on configuring my docker-compose stacks for my server, perhaps as a mentee role to better accelerate my learning.
- 📫 How to reach me by following my profile and reaching out from there.
